Securely install the latest [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/) release from PyPI.

This action installs a pinned version of **isort** and all its dependencies,         making sure that file hashes match. Pinning your dependencies stops supply chain attacks where an adversary         replaces isort or one of its dependencies with malicious code.

## Usage

In your GitHub Actions workflow, use this action like so:

```yaml
- name: Install isort from PyPI
  uses: install-pinned/isort@512d63238618e70b48f2551f51c0de1def585a60  # 5.10.1
```

## Alternatives

This action is a relatively simple wrapper around the fantastic [pip-tools](https://pip-tools.rtfd.io)         and is most useful if there is no existing `requirements.txt`/`poetry.lock`/... infrastructure in place.         If you already pin all your dependencies in a single place, you don't need it!
